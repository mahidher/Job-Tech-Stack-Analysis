We are the de-facto technology standard for modeling and predicting consumer perception and preference related to food, beverage, and other consumer products. Our unique AI quantifies subjective data and predicts what many believe to be impossible: the individual taste preferences of over 3 billion consumer groups worldwide, today and in the future.   While AFS has 10+ years of sensory data, the database fits in memory and does not require ""big data"" techniques. Instead of large amounts of low dimensional data, we have a small amount of very high value high dimensional data. Working with such a data set gives the team a strong preference for mathematically elegant and thoughtful models - we care more about a deep understanding of the underlying statistics than the possibilities of deep neural networks. About the Role Our capabilities are evolving as we automate our prediction and reporting workflow on a new data platform. We are looking for experienced Data Scientists to join the team responsible for all data applications, including model building, model testing, benchmarking, data visualization, and model performance. AFS empowers the data science team to own all phases of the model development process. We look for data scientists who are excited by the challenge of solving problems using a wide array of modeling and quantitative techniques.   What You'll Do  Develop new models for new predictive capabilities. Test, train, update, or re-architect existing models with new data and research. Develop new interactive data visualizations for the customer reporting platform. Push the boundaries on sensory data applications by expanding our technological reach into new areas. Work with the data engineering and application engineering team to understand client requirements and translate requirements to model capabilities. Build reusable code and develop technical documents to represent new features. Less common areas of work may include: Time sensitive development of new models to rapidly test capabilities requested by a customer - while AFS does not build custom technology for any one customer, we will prioritize and align our product roadmap based on customer demand. Monitor mission-critical real-time analysis for product development cycles. Write technical white papers for presentation at research conferences (in collaboration with the AFS R&D team or R&D teams at other companies). Write technical blog posts to promote new features and capabilities.    What We Are Looking For  Masters or PhD in in a quantitative field such as Statistics, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science, or Economics. Experience processing, filtering, and presenting large quantities (Millions to Billions of rows) of data.  Superior verbal and written communication skills with the ability to effectively advocate technical solutions to scientists, engineering teams and business audiences.  Proven ability to convey rigorous technical concepts and considerations to non-experts. Natural curiosity and desire to learn.  Fluency in a scripting or computing language (e.g. Python, Scala, C++, Java, etc.) is a plus. Depth and breadth in quantitative knowledge.  Excellent quantitative modeling, statistical analysis skills and problem-solving skills.  Sophisticated user of statistical tools.  Combination of deep technical skills and business savvy to interface with all levels and disciplines within our and our customer’s organizations. Demonstrable track record of dealing well with ambiguity, prioritizing needs, and delivering results in a dynamic environment. Experience in forecasting and time series is a plus. Experience with Postgres for database, AWS for cloud resource, R for model building, Kubernetes, Clojure, Datomic, Argo, Terraform  How We Work  We're a New York-based distributed workforce. Our mission is to create a better-tasting world. Our decision-making is shaped by discovering and solving market and user problems, not by the corner office or ""smartest people in the room."" We value and prioritize transparent communication, believe that good ideas can (and do) come from anywhere, so we encourage Analytical Flavor Systems team members to work together across positions and roles.    We are currently fully remote but working out of our New York office as necessary, and situations permit. If you have a passion for rolling up your sleeves, building new programs, and have a solid team-player mentality, we'd love to hear from you!   Diversity & Inclusion At Analytical Flavor Systems  We're serious about growing diversity in the tech industry. We purposely built Analytical Flavor Systems to be a company where people love their work and show respect and empathy to their colleagues. Diversity typically includes but is not limited to differences in race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, political and religious affiliation, socioeconomic background, cultural background, geographic location, disabilities and abilities, relationship status, veteran status, and age. To work on diversity means that we welcome these differences and strive to increase the visibility of traditionally underrepresented groups. It also means that Analytical Flavor Systems employs a zero-tolerance policy for employees who exhibit behavior contrary to these principles.   Location: New York, NY (distributed workforce) Benefits: Analytical Flavor Systems, Inc. offers an excellent benefits package for full-time employees that includes Medical, Dental, Vision, 401K, unlimited PTO, paid company holidays, and an employee stock plan.

We have combined the multi-dimensional sensing capabilities of mobile phones with the power of embedded and cloud computing platforms and novel AI algorithms to continuously measure mental health status. We are realizing the vision of precision medicine for mental health by anticipating deterioration of mental health and delivering personalized, just-in-time interventions.We have built and tested this platform with $7M of NIH funding and are commercializing with a dual-track focus on pharma and US payors. Based on the elite quality of the team, the empirical evidence, and the innovation itself, we have closed a highly over-subscribed $11M seed financing with 36+ top Silicon Valley health tech and healthcare investors.

This contributes to reduced quality of care and poorer treatment outcomes, leading to higher dropout rates, ER visits, hospitalizations, etc. Mental health clinicians need objectives, continuously collected and easily interpretable patient data to fully appreciate patient status and enable quick, flexible, and targeted interventions. Patients and families need information that can help them to manage their own illness in a more effective manner.HealthRhythms is on a mission to become the world leader in objectively measuring mental health. We do this by capturing critical behavioral information -- from sleep/wake rhythms, and physical activity, to social engagement (patterns of out-of-home activity, patterns of technology use and screen time, etc.) and more -- to provide a more complete picture of individuals’ behavioral health with clinically actionable insight.Mental health clinicians, health systems and payers need objective, continuously collected and easily interpretable patient data to fully appreciate patient status and enable quick, flexible, and targeted interventions that lead to positive outcomes and reduced treatment costs. Patients, and their families, need information that can help them to manage their own illness in a more effective manner.It is time to re-imagine what the next generation of mental health care as universal health care can look like.This is a universal human problem - not local, not cultural, not tribal, this extends across all of humanity; there are different cultural expressions and it hits different cultures differently but we can bring a universal understanding to thisIf we can make the nature of this empirical and not invisible suffering then it is validating and we can remove the stigma associated with mental illnessImagine if your personal devices could really know you, know you in the sense of tracking a rich set of behaviors to continuously, accurately assess your mental healthImagine that machine learning translates that intimate knowledge of your daily behaviors into precise suggestions for behavior change that lead to improvement in symptoms of depression, anxiety and other mental disorders. This is the promise of digital phenotyping.Just as digital biomarkers can transform human access to mental health self-care, digital biomarkers can transform clinical support of more acute populations where there is a great unmet need.Our solutions ensure equity of access: they are accessible to anyone who owns a smartphone and has a connectivity contract or access WiFi. Our digital intervention platforms are accessible wherever there is cellular signal or WiFi available, bringing validated intervention to those who for either financial or geographic reasons do not have access to care.To learn more about the team Silicon Valley’s top venture capital firms deemed as world class for a mission focused on behavioral health, click here to see our team bios.Show less","b'Use Python to research and analyze sensor data streams|Employ statistical methods to build behavioral health profiles of users (with NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, etc.)|Apply cutting-edge machine learning tools to develop and evaluate predictive models on large sensor datasets to identify patients whose mental health is deteriorating or improving|Help in architecting metrics and algorithms to analyze, optimize, and personalize just-in-time interventions to improve mental health outcomes|Assist in streamlining our data pipeline from collection and cleaning to storage, and promote the adoption of best-practices in data science tools/techniques across the company|Communicate data science insights to both technical and non-technical members of the team through presentations (Jupyter Notebooks, Google Slides, etc.)|Master\xe2\x80\x99s or equivalent in statistics, mathematics, computer science, or related technical discipline|Practical experience with advanced machine learning techniques, ideally in a production environment|Deep familiarity with Python and relevant data science libraries (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, etc.)|Proficiency in shell scripting|Has a bright and open mind|Relishes a challenge, and is able to initiate and drive projects to completion with minimal guidance|Possesses strong written and verbal communication skills|Is a team player|Mental health as foundational to overall health.|Protecting patient privacy at all costs.

Splice,"Data Scientist, Product","New York, NY",4 weeks ago,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/data-scientist-product-at-splice-2875420512?refId=Nq5Hm6IsANzGKQcJQZMEgw%3D%3D&trackingId=4xn27fM5Abef%2FjzYxvpHeQ%3D%3D&position=6&pageNum=4&trk=public_jobs_jserp-result_search-card,"About The RoleAfter recently expanding Splice's offerings—first-party creator tools (Astra, Beatmaker, and Bridge) and education content (Skills)—we are looking for someone who can unlock greater understanding in how users adopt and engage with these areas of our product. We're interested in creating a unified, cohesive, and intuitive experience across our product ecosystem, so this role will require close collaboration with teams that oversee the core, cross-surface experience of our Sounds marketplace.Day to day this means balancing ad hoc data exploration and longer-running analytical projects; designing and conducting experiments; survey analysis; bridging the gap between Product Managers and Data Engineers to assure that data are accessible and easy to use for self-service reporting; and creating the essential metrics, reporting, and dashboards so the Product team and company have insight into the above-mentioned feature areas.Why Splice?Music starts at Splice. As a collection of artists, producers, creators and collaborators, Splice sweats every detail involved in the creative process. From our expansive library of content, to the tools we provide, to our company work culture, we're constantly evolving towards being the best advocates for our artists and employees. If you work at Splice you'll be asked, ""what does music mean to you?"" That's because music is at the core of everything we do. It's why we hire trailblazers to help us solve problems, navigate uncharted territory, and change the industry for the better. It's why we seek out diversity in who we hire, represent and collaborate with to ensure that we're growing towards a more inclusive and open minded reality. And it's why we hold ourselves accountable for our part in shaping music creation.Skills we're looking for:Data manipulationWe expect our Data Scientists to have strong analytical SQL skills. This means fluidity constructing statements that rely on a combination of joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and window functions. This role will work with large-scale data, so this person must have experience writing efficient, performance-optimized queries.Metric creationThis individual will be responsible for taking in loosely structured problems or objectives and devising useful metrics that drive us toward solutions. This process will require taking on a user-centric perspective to identify key behavioral patterns in our products and translate these into metrics that will be used in decision making—in a sense, choosing the optimal methodology while also thoughtfully constructing scalable and intuitive user interfaces for whatever metric or analysis is built.AnalysisMost problems benefit from models that can be interpreted to drive human action. We're seeking an individual who enjoys experimentation and statistical analysis—someone who can translate what they see in the data into useful product recommendations. A thorough understanding of statistical inference is required.Technical RequirementsStrong experience with analytical SQL (ideally BigQuery, Snowflake, or a similar MPP data warehouse).Hands-on experience with self-service analytics tools (e.g., Looker, Mixpanel, Tableau).Training in statistics or econometrics, with plenty of real-world experience applying these methodologies.Familiarity with a programming language typically used for statistical analysis and machine learning (preferably Python).Exposure to a variety of data sets used for product analytics—chiefly, large-scale event data (e.g., Mixpanel, Segment, GA 360, or Snowplow) and normalized transactional databases (e.g., e-commerce or subscription datasets).Additional CommentsThere are no specific degree requirements for this role: we appreciate and seek out diverse backgrounds. Instead of any particular formal education requirement, we'll flesh out what you've built, what you know, and how you approach problem solving.As a company that serves musicians and producers, some knowledge of the music-production process is definitely an asset. If this topic is new to you, that's okay—you should be open to learning about it.Equal Opportunity Employer:Splice is an equal opportunity employer, committed to diversity and inclusiveness. We will consider all qualified applicants without regard to race, color, nationality, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, disability or age.Show less","b'Strong experience with analytical SQL (ideally BigQuery, Snowflake, or a similar MPP data warehouse).|Hands-on experience with self-service analytics tools (e.g., Looker, Mixpanel, Tableau).|Training in statistics or econometrics, with plenty of real-world experience applying these methodologies.|Familiarity with a programming language typically used for statistical analysis and machine learning (preferably Python).|Exposure to a variety of data sets used for product analytics\xe2\x80\x94chiefly, large-scale event data (e.g., Mixpanel, Segment, GA 360, or Snowplow) and normalized transactional databases (e.g., e-commerce or subscription datasets).'"
