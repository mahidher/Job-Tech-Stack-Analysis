As a result, more and more companies are rushing to stand up their data stack and become data-powered organizations.But every data-powered company quickly encounters one unfortunate fact: much of their data is missing, stale, corrupt, or prone to unexpected and unwelcome changes. As a result, companies spend more time dealing with issues in their data rather than unlocking that data's value.Anomalo addresses this problem by adding a new layer to the Modern Data Stack: a Data Quality Platform that monitors enterprise data to automatically detect and root-cause any data issues, thus allowing teams to resolve any hiccups with their data before making decisions, running operations, or powering models.We help companies trust the data they use to make decisions and build products.We work with some of the biggest brands like BuzzFeed, Discover Financial Services, and Substack. We're raised over $39m in seed and Series A funding backed by top-tier venture firms like Norwest Venture Partners, Foundation Capital, Two Sigma Ventures, and First Round Capital.

This is NOT an entry/junior level position.)Cognomotiv’s MarketThe complexity of modern vehicles is increasing at a breathtaking rate. The introduction of an array of brand-new features, along with refinements on old capabilities, has wildly expanded the role of software in today’s vehicles. More and more functionality is shifting from electronic and mechanical systems to onboard computers controlled by software. The physical and digital worlds are fusing to form phygital. This trend is only accelerating: with ubiquitous electrification and myriad new services rely heavily on vehicles being constantly online. Software and high-tech offer amazing new opportunities to the vehicles and transportation worlds, but with it comes the complexity that creates operational failures–intentional or unintentional- due to underlying hardware or the software that controls it. That’s where Cognomotiv comes into the picture.Who We AreAt Cognomotiv, we help vehicle manufacturers, suppliers, and operators measure and validate the reliability, availability, and uptime of every vehicle on the road, on rails, or in the sky, thanks to state-of-the-art AI that leverages a hybrid of edge and cloud computing to identify anomalous vehicle behavior in real-time.Cognomotiv technology is a highly optimized blend of edge and cloud AI (CHAI: Cognomotiv Hybrid AI) that performs non-intrusive system diagnosis and prognosis and makes remediation recommendations with powerful and efficient native models. Our AI is unique in its ability to perform sophisticated fault and failure detection and prediction in a resource-constrained environment, and provides recommendations on what to do about the problems it finds (guided repair). Additionally, these models are seamlessly coupled and continuously improving with our powerful composite, distributed, and federated learning infrastructure.Role DescriptionWe want an ambitious, self-reliant, self-starter, startup-material, and a 10X  data science engineer who operates with a sense of urgency and has the ability to thrive in a scale-up environment to join our team. You will design, fast-prototype, and build the robust, supportable, highly scalable ML/DL models for Cognomotiv’s hybrid architecture to:Optimize and test ML and statistical models to report and predict vehicle health in a variety of subsystems, including mechanical, sensor, and onboard computers.Research and develop methods for anomaly detection, diagnosis, and ultimately root cause analysis using vehicle data streams.Organize and manage fleet data flow, storage, and automated procedures.Use cloud resources to mine fleet databases for fault patterns and precursors.Design and execute in-house mechanical, sensor, and computer experiments.Organize and clearly and succinctly present, communicate and publish findings.Design and implement models to detect breaches in-vehicle cybersecurity.Assist in porting models to native language for edge computation and learning.Ideal candidates possess deep technical skills and drive insights into new products, working closely within data science and the rest of engineering.  You will have the opportunity to synthesize learning from edge-trained models, a paradigm the entire IoT is striving for.  You will have access to new and rich datasets, and use them to directly provide safety and reliability to hundreds of millions.Education & Skills RequirementsDegree (advanced preferred) in a quantitative field such as statistics or physicsIndustry experience in a data science roleProficiency in large-scale data interaction -- SQL, Hadoop, etc.Solid Python skills, especially with NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and SKLearn libraries.
